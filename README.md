# Project Name
> We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.


## Observations
* based on R Score on test sample this model can be assumed to explain roughly 77% of the variance seen in daily ridership
* the feeling temperature is the most important determinant of ridership with higher temperature generally seeing higher ridership
* as weather situation becomes worse ridership falls, highest fall being in case of weather situation 3
* it can also be seen that ridership increased in 2019 compared to 2018 all other factors being constant
* winter and summer see increased ridership
